# Pizza Hut Sales Analysis Dashboard

## 📊 Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive **Sales Analysis Dashboard built in Microsoft Excel**, focusing on Pizza Hut’s performance across different cities, pizza types, toppings, and monthly trends. It demonstrates how Excel can be used not only for raw data analysis, but also for **interactive dashboards**, visual insights, and decision support.

The same structure and KPIs can also be scaled to **Power BI** for real-time, large-scale analysis in future phases.
